## Animations? Synthwave? Fluoromachine? Cursor? What's not to love ðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ’–

This is a fork of Robb Owen's excellent [Synthwave '84 theme](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode), merged with the iconic [Fluoromachine](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/FluoroMachine/) color palette, and enhanced with [Epic 80s Animations](https://github.com/thecodemonkey/synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations). The result is a neon-drenched coding environment that combines the best of multiple worlds: the modern infrastructure of Synthwave '84, the vibrant purple and cyan aesthetics of Fluoromachine, and smooth retro animations.

__No external extensions needed!__ The glow effect is built-in and can be toggled on/off with simple commands.

## Features

- __Fluoromachine color palette__: Purple (#8a2dc0), cyan (#61e2ff), and hot pink (#fc199a) dominate the theme
- __Built-in neon glow__: Token-level text shadows create that authentic neon aesthetic
- __Epic 80s animations__: Hover effects, pulsing tooltips, animated cursors, and more
- __3D perspective grid__: Retro-futuristic grid effect at the bottom of your editor
- __Scanlines overlay__: Subtle CRT monitor effect for maximum nostalgia
- __Configurable brightness__: Adjust the glow intensity to your preference
- __Enhanced language support__: Go, Clojure, Python, C/C++, Elixir, Markdown, Dart, Scala, and more

## Installation

Install from the VS Marketplace (once published) or install locally:

```bash
cd synthwave-fluoromachine-cursor
code --install-extension synthwave-fluoromachine-cursor-0.2.0.vsix
```

## Enabling Neon Dreams

The theme works beautifully out of the box, but to enable the full neon glow effect:

### Prerequisites

- __Windows users__: You may need to run VS Code with administrator privileges
- __Linux/Mac users__: Ensure VS Code is not installed in a read-only location and you have write permissions

### Steps

1. Set your active color theme to __Synthwave Fluoromachine (Cursor/VS Code)__
2. Open your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + âŒ˜ + P`
3. Choose "__Enable Neon Dreams__"
4. Restart VS Code when prompted

The neon glow should now be active!

### Customizing the Glow

#### Adjust brightness

In your `settings.json`, add:

```json
"synthwave84.brightness": 0.45
```

The value should be a float from 0 to 1, where 0.0 is fully transparent. The default is 0.45. After changing, rerun "__Enable Neon Dreams__" to apply.

#### Disable glow but keep chrome updates

In your `settings.json`, add:

```json
"synthwave84.disableGlow": true
```

Then rerun "__Enable Neon Dreams__" to apply.

### Disabling Neon Dreams

Open your command palette and choose "__Disable Neon Dreams__", then restart VS Code.

## Fixing the Corruption Warning

Because enabling the glow modifies core VS Code files, you may see a "corrupted" warning. You can safely dismiss this, or remove it entirely with the [Fix VSCode Checksums](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums) extension.

After installing, run `Fix Checksums: Apply` from the command palette, then fully restart VS Code.

## Updates

Every time VS Code updates, you'll need to rerun "__Enable Neon Dreams__" to restore the glow effect.

## Font Recommendation

The theme works with any font, but for that authentic retro-futuristic look, try:

- [Operator Mono](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig) (with ligatures)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (with ligatures)
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

The font being used in the screenshot above is Operator Mono with Ligatures.
